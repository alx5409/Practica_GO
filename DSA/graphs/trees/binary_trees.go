package binaryTrees

// Exercise 1: Implement a function to insert a value into a binary search tree.

// Exercise 2: Write a function to search for a value in a binary tree (not necessarily a BST).

// Exercise 3: Implement a function to find the minimum and maximum value in a binary search tree.

// Exercise 4: Write a function to calculate the height (maximum depth) of a binary tree.

// Exercise 5: Implement functions for preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals of a binary tree.

// Exercise 6: Write a function to check if a binary tree is balanced.

// Exercise 7: Implement a function to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree.

// Exercise 8: Write a function to count the number of leaf nodes in a binary tree.

// Exercise 9: Implement a function to check if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST).

// Exercise 10: Write a function to mirror (invert) a binary tree.

// Exercise 11: Implement a function to print all paths from root to leaf in a binary tree.

// Exercise 12: Write a function to calculate the sum of all nodes in a binary tree.

// Exercise 13: Implement a function to delete a node from a binary search tree.

// Exercise 14: Write a function to check if two binary trees are identical.

// Exercise 15: Implement a function to find the diameter (longest path) of a binary tree.
